# file-shortener

### Improvements

Would be better to reverse the iterator and count up to the desired amount of lines.
Remove the count() on the amount of lines, it is inefficient
Make a help flag

### Additions

make it possible to use desired bytes instead of lines. Its more accurate if the intention is to decrease file size rather than length + more efficient
use -p / --path, -l / --lines, -b / --bytes and -h / --help
